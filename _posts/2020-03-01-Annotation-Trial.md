As part of our project with Innovate UK and the UK's Geospatial Commission we have developed new tools for people to crowdsource the state of the neighbourhoods.

We are now adding automated data feeds to Synced marks, starting with recently reported crimes in the UK. We're also starting a new crowdsourced annotation feed. These new features will give people more information on the places they care about, and the ability to express their views on places.

The Synced app lets users "mark" places with information. These marks are then shown to other Synced users as they walk past, and to explorers worldwide. Our users can and do mark anything, from amazing places they discovered through to cute cats they came across on their wanders. Once created, a mark can be edited and commented on by other users, and over time marks thus evolve to become the digital representation of a place and its community.

We're now automatically adding data to marks to give a more complete representation of a place for residents and explorers. Working with the UK's Geospatial Commission we are starting by showing the recently reported crimes at a mark's location.

We've also added a new crowdsourced feed. Users can add data to a location themselves by using the new mini-mark functionality. By holding the Mark button, locations can be labeled as #lovely, #busy, #polluted, #rundown and #unsafe with more options to come.

We're currently trialing these features in Cambridge, Oxford and East London. We'll be following these new features up in the coming months with more datasets to inform residents, explorers and city planners.
