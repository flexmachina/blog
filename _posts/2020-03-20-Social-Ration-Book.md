This week the UK and US recently shifted gear in their strategy towards the coronavirus, 
introducing voluntary measures which would drastically affect people's lives over the next few months (possibly longer). 
Key to these measures is asking people to avoid non-essential social contact with friends and family.

In the UK many people have listened to the government's requests and have started to limit non-essential social contact. 
But humans are social creatures, and plenty (myself included) will find social distancing a challenge. Based on what
I've seen around me, I think people will try to socially distance with the best of intentions but will inevitably slip up. 

In some countries and regions, where the virus is further along, lockdowns have been enforced for months at a time. 
This has been effective in quelling the virus. However, there is much talk in the scientific community about a second wave 
of infections, and in a grimmer scenario a cycle of new infections followed by lockdowns. I imagine after a first wave lockdown, subsequent lockdowns will be increasingly affecting for people. 

The UK government has said we are on a war footing, and it got me thinking about previous wartime approaches to 
meet people's needs when resources are scarce. Specifically the ration book:

Ration books were used on multiple occasions in 20th centiry Britain to ration food during wartime. They were given to everyone in Britain who then registered in a shop of their choice.  When something was purchased the shopkeeper marked the purchase off in the customerâ€™s book. Petrol coupons were also issued for a short time during the 1973 oil crisis, but were never used in the end.

During this pandemic, we're going to have to limit social contact. But human nature being what it is, how realistic 
is it to stop it entirely for prolonged periods of time? So here's a crazy idea, what about a social ration book?

People would receive a certain number of tokens a month, which they could use to leave the house for non-essential socializing (i.e. trips to the supermarket or essential work wouldn't be rationed). The venue they visit would then take the token (which may also tie into the venue receiving government assistance). 

Today's social rationing book would be implemented as an app. Tokens would be issued dynamically as barcodes venues can scan. That way the government will be able to more surgically stop the virus spreading in secondary outbreaks with less impact on people's lives. For example, the virus is currently spreading faster in London than in other parts of the UK, so Londoners would receive fewer monthly social rationing tokens. Such a tool would also help with contact tracing during outbreaks, as they would know where people used their socializing tokens.

Many people will already understand the idea, based on the experiences of older generations. 
Plus the prospect of being able to see people will keep the spirits up as opposed to an indefinite isolation. Counterintuitively, in a pre-lockdown situation perhaps this would result in more overall social distancing, as people won't be lapsing 

This might be a bit too out there, but maybe those populations who might be considered more at risk could also get tokens, 
but just less frequently. The reason this might work is that on a larger scale maybe under social rationing would 
put less pressure on the health system, and people could get ICU treatment should the need arise.

I am most definitely not an epidemiologist, but as a social tool to limit virus spread a social ration book seems like an interesting idea.
