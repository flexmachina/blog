This week the UK and US recently shifted gear in their strategy towards the coronavirus, 
introducing voluntary measures which would drastically affect people's lives over the next few months (possibly longer). 
Key to these measures is asking people to avoid non-essential social contact with friends and family.

In the UK many people have listened to the government's requests and have started to limit non-eesential social contact. 
But humans are social creatures, and plenty (myself included) will find social distancing a challenge. Based on what
I've seen around me, I think people will try to socially distance with the best of intentions but will inevitably slip up. 

In some countries and regions, where the virus is further along, lockdowns have been enforced for months at a time. 
This has been effective in quelling the virus. However, there is much talk in the scientific community about a second wave 
of infections, and in a grimmer scenario a cycle of new infections followed by lockdowns. I imagine after a first wave lockdown, 
subsequent lockdowns will be increasingly affecting for people. 

The UK government has said we are on a war footing, and it got me thinking about previous wartime approaches to 
meet people's needs when resources are scarce. Specifically the ration book:

Ration books were used on multiple occasions in 20th centiry Britain to ration food during wartime. 
Petrol coupons were also issued for a short time during the 1973 oil crisis, but were never used in the end.

During this pandemic, we're going to have to limit social contact. But human nature being what it is, how realistic 
is it to stop it entirely for prolonged periods of time. So here's a crazy idea, what about a social ration book?


Many people will already understand the idea, based on the experiences of older generations. 
Plus the prospect of being able to see people will keep the spirits up as opposed to an indefinite isolation.

This might be a bit too out there, but maybe those populations who might be considered more at risk could also get tokens, 
but just less frequently. The reason this might work is that on a larger scale maybe under social rationing would 
put less pressure on the health system, and people could get ICU treatment should the need arise.

I am most definitely not an epidemiologist, but as a social tool to limit virus spread a social ration book seems like an interesting idea.


- Point out finer grained regional control with tokens (London vs UK)
- Counterintuitively may involve less overall social contact than current approach
- whack a mole for months
